                Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? Vito, how do
                you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? Only don't tell me you're
                innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I see
                you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? The hotel, the
                casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out.

            <p>
                The best sandwich is a mutton, lettuce and tomato, where the mutton is nice
                and lean. It's so perky, I love that.

        <p>
            My favorite TV show of all time is The Muppet Show. It's sweet, funny and
            brilliant.

        <aside>
            <h3>The Muppet Show</h3>
            <p>The Muppet Show was created by Jim Henson and aired from 1976 – 1981.</p>

            You can use this for a piece of code such as:
            <code class="gray-code">const muppetFrog = 'Kermit'</code>, which looks
            different from the other text.
        </p>

        <article class="all-muppets">
